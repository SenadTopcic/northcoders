# JavaScript Function Explanations
This repository contains explanations for a series of JavaScript functions. Each function addresses a specific task and is described briefly below.

## 1. getLength.js
Write a function that takes a string and returns the length of that string as a number.

## 2. putNamesTogether.js
Write a function that takes two arguments (firstName and secondName) and returns a string of both names joined together with a space.

## 3. capitaliseString.js
Write a function that takes a string and returns the string with the first letter capitalised.

## 4. dontShoutSentence.js
Write a function that takes a string in capital letters and returns the string with just the first letter being capitalised.

## 5. getMiddle.js
Write a function that takes a string and returns the middle character for an odd-length string, or the two middle characters for an even-length string.

## 6. getLastWord.js
Write a function that takes a string and returns the last word.

## 7. hyphenateWords.js
Write a function that takes a string and returns a string with all of the words joined by a hyphen.

## 8. convertToCamelCase.js
Write a function that takes a string and returns the string in camel case. This means all spaces should be removed, and every word other than the first should be capitalised.

## 9. passwordValidation.js
Northcoders takes security very seriously. We have a VERY robust password criteria.
Any password must include 'n' and 'c' (upper or lowercase) and must end with '1'.
Design this function to check the password that is passed to it. If it fulfills all of the above criteria then you should return 'valid'. Otherwise, return 'invalid'.
